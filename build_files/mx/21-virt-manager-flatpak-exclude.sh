# MX block 21: hide the virt-manager flatpak from Discover/Bazaar.
#
# Companion to 20-virtualization.sh (virt-manager comes from the Fedora
# repo as rpm). virt-manager is NOT in Bazzite's default-install list,
# so only the blocklist is patched, not the install list.
#
# Reference Bazzite files:
#  /usr/share/ublue-os/flatpak-blocklist         (Flathub remote filter)

### Extend flatpak-blocklist with virt-manager ###
# Idempotent: append only if the line isn't already there. We extend
# instead of replacing so we don't drop upstream entries (Steam,
# Lutris, Firefox-from-62-firefox-flatpak-exclude.sh, ...).

# MX block 72: install the out-of-tree ntfsplus module built in the kmod-builder
# stage, regenerate modules.dep, and drop the two generic mount.ntfs helper
# symlinks so the driver is reachable by filesystem type. The driver is Linux
# 7.1's in-tree fs/ntfs (NTFSPLUS), which the ogc kernel builds with
# CONFIG_NTFS_FS off; it registers the filesystem type "ntfs" and the kernel
# loads it on demand at the first mount of that type, so no autoload and no ujust
# recipe ship with it. updates/ mirrors the in-tree path, so a later ogc build
# that enables CONFIG_NTFS_FS is overridden by depmod priority.

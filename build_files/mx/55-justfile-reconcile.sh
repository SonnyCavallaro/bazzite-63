# MX block 55: reconcile the ujust justfile tree.
#
# 1. Surgical removal — strips every upstream recipe that bazzite-mx replaces
#    (our versions live in 96-bazzite-mx-overrides.just). `just` rejects
#    duplicate recipe names across imports (no allow-duplicate-recipes), so the
#    upstream copy MUST be removed at build time.
# 2. Import registration — Bazzite's master /usr/share/ublue-os/justfile uses
#    explicit `import` directives (no glob); our files are not loaded by `ujust`
#    until their imports are registered there.

# remove_recipe NAME FILE — edits FILE in place. Runs the awk into a temp file:
# awk exit 0 (recipe header matched) → rewrite FILE from temp, return 0; awk
# exit 3 (header never matched) → drop temp, leave FILE untouched, return 3.
# The `if` guard keeps `set -e` from tripping on the non-match path.
# The rewrite is `cat tmp > FILE`, never `mv tmp FILE`: mktemp creates 0600
# files and mv carries that mode onto the justfile, which ujust then cannot
# read as an unprivileged user. The truncate-write keeps FILE's inode, owner
# and 0644 mode.
#
# The awk is a buffered-lead state machine: comment/attribute lines preceding a
# recipe are held so they can be dropped together with the recipe they decorate,
# but a top-of-file header block (nothing emitted before it) is preserved.

### Section 1: remove any pre-existing Fedora-repo firefox ###
# Catches the Fedora rpm before the Mozilla install resolves to the
# wrong provider. Gate the remove on `rpm -q` rather than `|| true`:
# "not installed" is an explicit skip, while a real `dnf5 remove`
# failure still fails the build.

# Extend the language list by adding firefox-l10n-<code> below.

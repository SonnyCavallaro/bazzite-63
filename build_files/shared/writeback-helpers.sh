# Torn-writeback helper: rewrite a base-image file onto a fresh inode.
#
# The runner kernel loses page writeback of in-place writes into copied-up
# overlay files, so the committed layer ships a NUL tail while the build
# stays green. The rule: a script whose last write to a base-image file is
# in place calls rewrite_fresh_inode on it before it exits. Full class,
# measured idiom table and production hits: docs/conventions.md
# § "Writing base-image files" and gotcha #40.

# rewrite_fresh_inode FILE... — copy each file onto a brand-new inode,
# fsync it, and rename it over the original. Mode, ownership and timestamps
# carry over, so the justfile tree keeps the 0644 that ujust needs.

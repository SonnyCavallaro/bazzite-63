# NO `dnf5 versionlock clear` here. Bazzite pins 21 packages with
# `versionlock add` (upstream Containerfile:152,671): the whole kernel stack,
# the six Valve-patched mesa packages, bluez*, wireplumber*, Xwayland and
# NetworkManager*. Clearing them shipped a 31 B `packages = []` where the base
# carries 4207 B (MEASURED 2026-09-01), so any dnf5 transaction on the host or
# in an image layered on top of ours can pull an unpatched mesa or a kernel
# that no longer matches its modules. The line came from aurora's clean-stage,
# which pins nothing and has nothing to lose by it.
# check-image-integrity.sh section 9 holds the invariant on the cold bytes.

# Drop libdnf5's build-time state (pattern from aurora cf4bc197, PR #2580).
# Every file under this directory changes on every build -- timestamps,
# package versions, the transaction history dnf5 writes -- so the libdnf5
# package's chunk is unique per build and every `bootc upgrade` re-downloads
# it (~600 KB: nevras.toml 89 KB, packages.toml 66 KB, transaction_history
# .sqlite 434 KB, MEASURED 2026-09-01 on localhost/bazzite-mx:preflight).
# `dnf5 history` is not the tool for an atomic image -- the build log is --
# and deleting the sqlite here removes it from the torn-writeback surface
# entirely: build.sh step 4 no longer vacuums it and the cold check asserts
# the directory stays empty instead of probing the database.

# terra-mesa.repo is the one third-party repo the base ships with a file-level

# 99-config_manager.repo instead (bazzite Containerfile:126, the `setopt` idiom
# of gotcha #1), while terra-extras.repo it seds. The effective state is the
# same today, but one dropped override line makes a Terra repo fully live on
# every deployed host, with a green build and a green cold check -- neither
# validator reads repos.override.d. Both files are registered in
# third-party-repos.list now, and this sed makes the file-level invariant they
# enforce true. `sed -i` renames onto a fresh inode, so it is writeback-safe
# (conventions.md, Writing base-image files).

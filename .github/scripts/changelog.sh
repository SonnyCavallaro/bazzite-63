# Emit the Markdown body for a bazzite-mx GitHub Release on stdout:
# intro + Upstream section (Bazzite compare diff) + image digest table
# for the 3 variants + commits table + How-to-rebase + cosign verify hint.
#
# Usage:
#   changelog.sh <upstream_tag> <release_tag> <prev_tag> \
#                <digest_main> <digest_nvidia> <digest_nvidia_open> \
#                [stream_name] [prev_upstream]
#
# stream_name (default "stable") drives the bootc switch tag in "How to rebase"
# (:stable vs :testing) so users land on the right mutable channel.
# prev_upstream is the upstream tag the previous release was built off
# (recovered by the caller from that release's title); empty when unknown.
#
# Env vars (auto-populated by GitHub Actions, override for local testing):
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER  e.g. MatrixDJ96
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY        e.g. MatrixDJ96/bazzite-mx

### How to rebase

For current users, run:

\`\`\`bash
# For the latest ${STREAM_NAME} (mobile tag, follows future releases automatically):
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/${OWNER_LC}/bazzite-mx:${STREAM_NAME}

# For this specific release (immutable, pinned):
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/${OWNER_LC}/bazzite-mx:${RELEASE_TAG}
\`\`\`

### Verify

Each image is signed at build time. Before rebasing in security-sensitive contexts:

\`\`\`bash
cosign verify --key ${COSIGN_PUB_URL} <ref>
\`\`\`

# Promote one stream's signed staging digests onto their release tags.
#
# Usage:
#   promote-release-tags.sh <stream_name>
#
# Reads the promote-*-<stream_name> manifests downloaded under promote/ and
# digest-copies each flavour's signed staging manifest onto its tag list.
# Env: GH_TOKEN (gh auth), GITHUB_REPOSITORY, IMAGE_REGISTRY, MATRIX_INCLUDE
# (the JSON build matrix — the expected flavour count is DERIVED from it,
# never a literal, so a flavour change moves the gate with it).
#
# Per-stream gate: a manifest shortfall aborts BEFORE any tag moves. A
# flavour whose sibling never built must not ship, while the OTHER stream's
# promotion, running in its own job, stays untouched — the failure is loud,
# never a silent skip.

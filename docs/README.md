# `docs/` — deep project knowledge

Tool-agnostic reference material referenced from the root `AGENTS.md` but **not
auto-loaded**. Read the relevant file when a topic comes up:

| File | Read when… |
|---|---|
| [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) | Discussing build flow, repo layout, Containerfile stages, CI matrix, why a design is shaped this way. |
| [`conventions.md`](conventions.md) | Writing new bash, editing scripts, adding a third-party repo, extending smoke tests, choosing a commit message. |
| [`workflow.md`](workflow.md) | Starting a new phase, deciding when to push, deciding whether to do a code review round, handling a CI failure. |
| [`gotchas.md`](gotchas.md) | A familiar-looking error appears (silent dnf5 setopt, HEAD-rejecting CDN, paths-ignore behaviour, etc.). Always check here first. |
| [`upstream-divergences.md`](upstream-divergences.md) | Understanding what bazzite-mx intentionally changes over upstream `bazzite-dx` and why, plus the design philosophy behind the divergences. |

Update these files **as you discover** new conventions, gotchas, or preferences
— do not let knowledge stay only in the chat transcript.

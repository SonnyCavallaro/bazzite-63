# Conventions

## Bash scripts (everything under `build_files/`)

- **Shebang — two families**: in-image scripts (`build_files/`, `system_files/` hooks) use
  `#!/usr/bin/bash` (Bazzite ships bash at that path); host-side scripts (`.claude/hooks/`,
  `.github/scripts/`) use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` (portable across dev hosts and CI runners).
- **Strict mode**: `set -euxo pipefail` for orchestration scripts and the numbered
  `build_files/mx/*.sh` install scripts. The `-x` is intentional — every command echoed in
  CI logs locates a failure precisely.
  - **Exception**: `validate-repos.sh` uses `set -eou pipefail` (no `-x`) because its own
    `echo` output is the report and `-x` would garble it. Matches Aurora upstream's
    `validate-repos`.
  - **Exception**: sourced helper libraries (`copr-helpers.sh`) use `set -euo pipefail`
    (no `-x`): the caller's own `-x` already echoes every command the helpers run.
- **Log grouping**: wrap the script body with `echo "::group:: ===$(basename "$0")==="` and
  `echo "::endgroup::"` so the GitHub Actions UI nests the output collapsibly.
- **Don't hide errors**: never `|| true` to silence failures unless the failure is genuinely
  benign (masking a non-existent service file is acceptable; a failing `install` is not).
- **Loops over arrays**: prefer `for item in "${ARRAY[@]}"; do ...; done` to repeated
  commands — easy to extend, easy to test.
- **Script enumeration**: iterate files matching a pattern via
  `mapfile -t list < <(find DIR -maxdepth 1 -type f -name 'PATTERN' | sort -V)`, never
  `for f in $(ls ...)` — the latter splits on whitespace and silently fails on empty matches
  under `set -e`. `sort -V` (version sort) orders `10-foo.sh` before `20-foo.sh` before
  `100-foo.sh`, unlike alphabetic sort.

## Comments in code

- **WHY, not WHAT** — well-named identifiers and `set -euxo pipefail` already tell you what
  each line does.
- Cite **provenance** in non-obvious patterns: "ported from Aurora upstream", "lifted 1:1
  from bazzite-dx", "verified empirically 2026-05-02 against dnf5 5.x".
- Cite **discovered gotchas**: when a script works around a documented pitfall (e.g. the
  `sed enabled=1→0` rule for runtime-added .repo files, gotcha #2), its comment names the
  pitfall — load-bearing, because without it the next refactor reverts to the broken
  idiom and silently breaks repo isolation.
- Avoid "added for issue #X" comments — they rot; the PR / commit body is the right place.

## Git

### Commit messages

- **Conventional Commits**: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. The scope names the **domain** the
  commit touches, matching the history (`git log --format=%s`):
  - `feat(<domain>): …` — a domain landing: `feat(virt)`, `feat(firefox)`, `feat(sunshine)`,
    `feat(msi-ec)`, `feat(ci)`, `feat(pages)`, …
  - `fix(<domain>): …` / `refactor(<domain>): …` — bug fix / restructuring within a domain,
    same scope as the commit that introduced it.
  - `docs: …` — documentation only (scope optional).
  - `chore(...): …` — housekeeping, e.g. `chore(claude)` for harness config; scaffold-level
    chores go scopeless (`chore: scaffold …`).
- Subject ≤ 70 chars, imperative mood.
- Body explains the WHY, not the WHAT — reference upstream comparisons, measurement results,
  and discoveries (e.g. "verified on Bazzite 44.20260501 / dnf5 5.x").
- **No attribution trailer** (`Co-Authored-By`, `Generated-By`, `Assisted-By`, …) unless the
  user explicitly asks for it on a specific commit.

### Push behaviour

- **Always pause for user confirmation before `git push`** — even on a clean pre-flight, a
  push triggers 6 CI jobs and is visible to the world.
- **Never** `--force`, `--no-verify`, or `--amend` without an explicit ask.

### Commit splitting

- **One concern per commit**: a phase introducing both new functionality and a refactor
  splits into two commits (`feat(...)` + `refactor(...)`).
- **Mode changes** (chmod +x) belong with the file's introducing commit when possible;
  standalone "chmod +x drive-by" lines in a refactor commit body are acceptable.

## dnf5 quirks (CRITICAL — keep this in working memory)

The `setopt` silent no-op — the most critical quirk — is gotcha #2 in
[`gotchas.md`](gotchas.md); workaround: `sed -i 's/^enabled=1/enabled=0/g'`.

| Quirk | Consequence | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| `dnf5 -y install --enablerepo=<id> …` is a **runtime-only override** | The .repo file's persistent `enabled=` value is unchanged | Pair with a vendored `enabled=0` repo file; install is one-shot, file remains correctly disabled |
| `dnf` (dnf4 binary) is a compat shim on F44+ | May not support some setopt syntaxes identically | Always invoke `dnf5` directly in build scripts |
| `dnf5 install URL` works | Lets us install packages with no upstream yum repo (e.g., GitKraken) | Use sparingly; document the trust model |

## Repo isolation invariant

Every third-party repo file in `system_files/etc/yum.repos.d/` ships `enabled=0`.
`validate-repos.sh` hard-enforces this for the explicit `OTHER_REPOS` list — the single
authoritative enumeration is `OTHER_REPOS=(…)` in `build_files/shared/validate-repos.sh`.

When adding a new third-party repo:

1. Vendor the .repo file in `system_files/etc/yum.repos.d/<name>.repo` with `enabled=0`.
2. Add `<name>.repo` to `OTHER_REPOS` in `validate-repos.sh`.
3. Use `dnf5 -y install --enablerepo=<section> <pkg>` in the mx script.

The catch-all sweep at the bottom of `validate-repos.sh` is **informational only** — it
lists every other `.repo` file's enabled state without failing the build, because core
Fedora/Bazzite repos (`fedora.repo`, `fedora-updates.repo`, `terra-mesa.repo`) are
legitimately `enabled=1`.

## COPR install pattern

Use `copr_install_isolated <user/copr> <package1> [package2…]` from
`build_files/shared/copr-helpers.sh`:

```
dnf5 -y copr enable <user/copr>
dnf5 -y copr disable <user/copr>
dnf5 -y install --enablerepo=copr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:<user>:<copr> <packages>
```

The COPR is enabled briefly (so dnf can write the .repo file with metadata), immediately
disabled (so the file becomes `enabled=0`), then the runtime-only `--enablerepo=` flag pulls
the packages without flipping the file back.

For `*-release` style RPMs (e.g. a hypothetical `tailscale-release` dropping a .repo file
via post-install scriptlet), the third-party repo rule applies unchanged: vendor the dropped
`.repo` under `system_files/etc/yum.repos.d/` with `enabled=0`, register its basename in
`OTHER_REPOS` (`validate-repos.sh`), and install with `--enablerepo=<section>`.

## Smoke tests (`build_files/tests/10-tests-mx.sh`)

- **One numbered file**, extended in-place per phase.
- Per-phase pattern:
  ```bash
  # --- Phase N: <domain> packages ---
  <DOMAIN>_RPMS=( pkg1 pkg2 ... )
  for p in "${<DOMAIN>_RPMS[@]}"; do
      rpm -q "$p" >/dev/null || { echo "FAIL: rpm $p missing"; exit 1; }
  done

  # --- Phase N: <domain> services ---
  <DOMAIN>_UNITS=( foo.service bar.socket )
  for u in "${<DOMAIN>_UNITS[@]}"; do
      state=$(systemctl is-enabled "$u" 2>/dev/null || echo missing)
      if [ "$state" != "enabled" ]; then
          echo "FAIL: $u not enabled (state=$state)"
          exit 1
      fi
  done
  ```
- The `state=$(... || echo missing)` pattern matters: `systemctl is-enabled` exits 0 also
  for `static`, `linked`, `indirect`, `alias` — the test wants `enabled` literally. The
  diagnostic `(state=$state)` in the FAIL message saves debugging time.
- File-existence checks: prefer `[ ! -x "$path" ]` for executables, plus a content check via
  `grep -q '<pattern>'` when the content matters.

## Vendoring third-party content

- **Default**: vendor the `.repo` file in git under `system_files/etc/yum.repos.d/` — an
  auditable diff in PR review.
- **Exception (URL-only RPMs)**: when the vendor publishes no yum repo, only a stable RPM
  URL, install via `dnf5 install <URL>` and document in the script why we deviate and what
  the trust model is. Current example: GitKraken
  (`https://release.gitkraken.com/linux/gitkraken-amd64.rpm`).

## When probing third-party download URLs

Use `curl -sL --range 0-1023 <url>` (GET partial 1KB), never `curl -I` (HEAD) — several CDNs
reject HEAD (GitKraken: HEAD returned 404, GET worked). Probing with GET also lets you
`file` / `xxd` the bytes to verify it's an RPM.

## File permissions

- Scripts under `build_files/mx/`, `build_files/shared/`, `build_files/tests/` →
  **mode 755** (`chmod +x`). systemd unit files → **mode 644**.
- Verify before commit: `git ls-files --stage | grep '^100755'`. Fix an accidental 644
  script with `chmod +x <file> && git update-index --chmod=+x <file>`.

## VSCode user defaults

`system_files/etc/skel/.config/Code/User/settings.json` is **minimal**:

```json
{ "update.mode": "none" }
```

Only the atomic-correctness fix (VSCode's self-updater fights a read-only /usr). No font,
theme, or formatter opinions imposed at distro level — those are user choices.

## VSCode repo

- `gpgcheck=1` is correct on Bazzite 44 — verified 2026-05-01 that the Microsoft .asc key
  (0xBE1229CF, fingerprint BC528686B50D79E339D3721CEB3E94ADBE1229CF) imports cleanly during
  the first dnf5 transaction. Bazzite-DX upstream sets `gpgcheck=0` behind a
  "FIXME: signature broken" comment that describes an older dnf/rpm version.
- **General rule**: verify an upstream claim by reading the code and running a quick test
  before copying a pattern — an upstream `FIXME` or workaround may already be stale (the
  `gpgcheck` case above is the canonical instance).

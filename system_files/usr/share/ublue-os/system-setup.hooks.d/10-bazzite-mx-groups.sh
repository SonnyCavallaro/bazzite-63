# bazzite-mx system-setup hook: append docker/libvirt groups and grant
# them to wheel users on first boot.
#
# Runs from /usr/libexec/ublue-system-setup as root (after rpm-ostreed,
# before systemd-user-sessions). Idempotency comes from libsetup.sh's
# version-script helper, which keeps state in
# /var/roothome/.local/share/ublue/setup_versioning.json (since /root
# is a symlink to /var/roothome on bootc atomic; persists across deploys).
#
# Bumping the third arg of `version-script` re-runs the hook on every
# user the next time the system boots (e.g. when TARGET_GROUPS changes).
# The docker group is created early by /usr/lib/sysusers.d/bazzite-mx-
# docker.conf via systemd-sysusers, so usermod -aG docker succeeds here.
